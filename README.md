# titanic_classification
Here in this project; I took data of the titanic dataset and used it for classification using logistic regression.
The platform which i used for analysis is python and its different libraries like pandas, numpy ,sklearn etc.
In this project i at first took the data and did EDA and after that i did different operations on the data set to make dataset more efficinet; which inturns helps us to get good accuracy in classfication.
I also plotted differnt graphs to get good visualization and classification report also so that we can get good idea on our classifcation result.
Titanic-Survival-Predictions
In this challenge, we have to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). This project predicts whether a person survived in Titanic tragedy using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). In this project , Logistic Regression Model is used.

Steps involved :
1 Import Libraries

2 EDA

3 Data Cleaning We have to fill the missing data in Age Feature.

4 Data preparation

5 Converting Categorical Features

6 Implement Model

7 Evaluation

Tools used
1 Numpy

2 Pandas

3 scikit learn

4 matplotlib

5 seaborn

Conclusion
After analysing the data we could see that approximately 20% of Age data is missing and 77% of cabin data is missing. Most of the people died in the Titanic Tragedy , only around 300 people survived.There were more males than females aboard the ship, roughly double the amount. More males died in Titanic Tragedy than females. The majority of the people traveling, had tickets to the 3rd class.

After evaluation, Our model predicts 76% of the time, a passengers survival correctly (precision). The recall tells us that it predicted the survival of 68% of the people who actually survived.The first row is about the not-survived-predictions: 129 passengers were correctly classified as not survived (called true negatives) and 24 where wrongly classified as not survived (false positives). The second row is about the survived-predictions: 37 passengers where wrongly classified as survived (false negatives) and 78 where correctly classified as survived (true positives).
