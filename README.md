# titanic_classification
Here in this project; I took data of the titanic dataset and used it for classification using logistic regression.
The platform which i used for analysis is python and its different libraries like pandas, numpy ,sklearn etc.
In this project i at first took the data and did EDA and after that i did different operations on the data set to make dataset more efficinet; which inturns helps us to get good accuracy in classfication.
I also plotted differnt graphs to get good visualization and classification report also so that we can get good idea on our classifcation result.
